## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure that you have node working on version 16.8.2 or higher. If you do not you can install it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/

#### Running in Production

In webpack.config.js, ensure mode is set to production. This will ensure the application is properly bundled for optimization.

```
module.exports = {
  mode: "production",
  ...
 }
```

> To run the build package in production mode run the following:

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run server`
3. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser

#### Running in Development

In webpack.config.js, ensure mode is set to development. This will ensure webpack re-bundles the application when changes are made.

```
module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  ...
 }
```

> To run the build package in development mode run the following commands:

1. `npm start`
2. `npm run server`
3. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
